\chapter{Tools and techniques}
The modeling of any system needs an essential set of geometrical tools and guidelines to ensure that the underlying physics of the system is represented as close as possible in the discrete domain. Approximations introduced at this stage has a major influence on the resemblances of the developed systems with those that are in nature. The same approximations are also the ones that enable a better numerical representation under the constraints of the existing modern computational framework.
